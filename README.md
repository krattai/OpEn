Open(source) Energy Project
===========================

The Open Energy Project has been created to encourage and support the development of publicly useful and useable energy systems which are not encumbered by proprietary constraints.

This project is NOT focused specifically on fringe science energy technologies, although those technologies are not excluded from this project.

This project is NOT focused on any specific energy source, rather could include any known or unknown energy source which can be used directly or indirectly for useful energy systems.

This project IS focused on energy systems and sources which could be useable by an individual and / or household, and / or which could be scaled up or down, depending on the user's need.

This project began on Nov. 1, 2014.
